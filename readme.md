The JavaAutomation project has been discontinued and no longer downloaded. The owner Java#9999 added a logger to their Windows version leading to a bad reputation on me. I wish I could say something but I will be like a snitch such as a snitch to a school. Any of the users affected are listed below:

If you're one of them, remember to revoke the cookie you used with the extension to prevent the loss of more robux ASAP! Unfortunately, I haven't earned anything from this, so I can't refund the affected users that lost their robux/limiteds. I thought it doesn't matter as long as I don't get in trouble with anyone. Well, I doubted that lot and sadly I am banned from mewt and some other servers. Sorry to the users that were affected and I hope you have a good day. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
